      <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
      <p>
        The Taj Mahal, an architectural masterpiece nestled in the heart of
        Agra, India, stands as a timeless testament to love and beauty.
        Commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved
        wife Mumtaz Mahal, this iconic monument has captured the imagination of
        millions with its exquisite design and poignant backstory.
        <br />
        Constructed between 1631 and 1653, the Taj Mahal is a marvel of Mughal
        architecture, blending elements of Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles
        seamlessly. Its symmetrical layout, characterized by a grand central
        dome flanked by four minarets, reflects a sense of balance and harmony
        that is both mesmerizing and awe-inspiring. Crafted from white marble,
        the mausoleum glows with a soft luminescence under the golden rays of
        the sun, evoking a sense of ethereal beauty that seems almost
        otherworldly.
        <br />
        As one approaches the Taj Mahal, they are greeted by its majestic
        entrance gate, adorned with intricate carvings and calligraphy from the
        Quran, serving as a prelude to the splendor that lies beyond. Passing
        through the gate, visitors are greeted by a meticulously manicured
        garden, divided into symmetrical quadrants by reflecting pools that
        mirror the grandeur of the monument above. The pathway leading to the
        mausoleum is flanked by lush greenery and fragrant blooms, creating a
        sensory experience that is as enchanting as it is unforgettable.
        <br />
        Ascending the steps of the platform upon which the Taj Mahal rests, one
        is struck by the sheer scale and magnificence of the structure before
        them. The central dome, reaching a height of over 70 meters (230 feet),
        dominates the skyline, its pure white marble adorned with intricate
        inlay work of semi-precious stones such as lapis lazuli, jade, and
        turquoise. The facade of the mausoleum is adorned with delicate
        arabesques and floral motifs, each intricately carved by skilled
        artisans who dedicated years of their lives to its creation.
        <br />
        Stepping inside the Taj Mahal, visitors are greeted by the serene
        interior of the mausoleum, where the cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz
        Mahal lie side by side, forever entwined in eternal love. The walls are
        adorned with exquisite marble screens, delicately carved with geometric
        patterns that filter the soft light streaming in from the arched
        windows, casting a warm glow over the sacred space. The silence within
        is palpable, broken only by the whispers of awe from those who have come
        to pay their respects to the enduring bond between emperor and empress.
        <br />
        Beyond its architectural brilliance, the Taj Mahal holds a deeper
        significance as a symbol of enduring love and devotion. It stands as a
        monument to the power of love to transcend time and space, inspiring all
        who gaze upon it to believe in the eternal nature of true love. As the
        sun sets and the marble facade of the Taj Mahal is bathed in the soft
        hues of twilight, it serves as a poignant reminder that love, like the
        Taj Mahal itself, is a timeless masterpiece that will never fade.
